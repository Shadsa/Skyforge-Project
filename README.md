# Skyforge-Project
Calculator for Skyforge

reddit : http://redd.it/3ghc1g

#Goal of the project :

The goal is to make a simple tool for player who can't bear excel sheat (or shit, it depend). I hope to add some cool feature later like dps optimizer, previsualisation of your progression, and other...
If you have any problem with it, guive me a feedback on the reddit.


#Using it :

To use it, just download the .rar archive, unzip it in a folder, and use the .exe file. You will not be able to use it directly in the .rar because some dll include in will not work. 

For any question or suggestion, please visit the reddit.

Have a nice game !


#Update 11/08/2015 :

In order to upgrade this project, I solved some bug and wrong traduction, and adding some feature which will be used in the next version. For the moment, I work alone so it could be slow. Into the next version, I hope that I can be able to add a new add-on in the calculator (graduate proficiency and prestige progression for more anticipation and optimization)
